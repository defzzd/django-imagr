#     ImagrUser should be based off of the standard built-in Django User, with the following enhancements:
#         Users should be able to follow other users.
#         Users should be able to see a list of the users the follow and the list of users following them.
#         Users should have a 'date_joined' field and an 'active' field that allows disabling an account.

#     Photo contains an image and meta-data associated with that image
#         Photos are owned by Users
#         Meta-data should include a title and a description.
#             A date_uploaded, date_modified and date_published field.
#             You should also have a 'published' field takes one of three values ('private', 'shared', 'public')
